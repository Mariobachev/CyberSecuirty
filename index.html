            <li>You know what? People suck at passwords. We use weak passwords, we reuse passwords. Or we write down passwords or store them in equally insecure ways. These practices make our data very vulnerable. It’s no surprise that attackers search exactly for that to  use that information for their own benefits. Thats why further down below on the webapge you'll read about the most famous password security risks and how to prevent them from happening.</li>

            <h3>Phishing/Sniffers/Keyloggers</h3>
            <div class="second">
                <p>One of the easiest ways to get access to someone’s password is to have them tell you. Through this method, hackers can even bypass the password authentication process.Attackers target users by tricking them into typing their passwords into malicious websites they control (known as phishing), by infiltrating insecure, unencrypted wireless or wired network (commonly known as sniffing), or by installing a keylogger (software or hardware) on a computer.</p>

            <div class="second">
                <p>A common way for attackers to access passwords is by brute forcing or cracking passwords. These methods use software or automated tools to generate billions of passwords and trying each one of them to access the user’s account and data until the right password is discovered.</p>

            <h3>Weak Passwords</h3>
            <div class="second">
                <p>Since users have to create their own passwords, it is highly likely that they won’t create a secure password. It might be because users want to have a password that’s easy to remember, or they aren’t up-to-date with password security best practices, or they use patterns to generate their passwords like using their name or birthdate in their passwords.</p>

            <div class="second">
                <p>Ensure that users have strong passwords with no maximum character limits. Make sure a password is a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols, and numbers. The challenge with passwords is that in order to be secure, they need to be unique and complex.

            <h3>Password Recovery</h3>
            <div class="second">
                <p>Most of the applications and systems provide a password recovery system for users who have forgotten their passwords or simply want to reset their passwords. Often attackers may attempt to hack user accounts by using the password recovery system.</p>
